::: {#hero-heading align="left"}
I am Professor and E. F. Lindquist Chair in the Educational Measurement and Statistics program, a part of the Department of Psychological and Quantitative Foundations in the College of Education at the University of Iowa.

My research interests are focused on the development of psychometric and general quantitative methods, as applied in the psychological, educational, and social sciences. I teach courses on advanced quantitative methodology with an emphasis on statistical modeling, model comparisons, and the integration and generalities of popular statistical and psychometric techniques.
